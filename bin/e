# Quick shortcut to an editor.
#
# This means that as I travel back and forth between editors, hey, I don't have
# to re-learn any arcane commands. Neat.
#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ e
#   # => opens the current directory in your editor
#
#   $ e .
#   $ e /usr/local
#   # => opens the specified directory in your editor

#Also if you store your session with .session.vim name
#it will open vim with that session
#For this to work with mvim, simply, alias m=e mvim

#dirname=${PWD##*/} 
vim_session_name=.session.vim
editor=vim
args=""

#check if we want to change EDITOR to macvim
if [ "$1" = "mvim" ]; then
    args=$2
    editor=mvim
else
    editor=$EDITOR
fi

if [ -f ./${vim_session_name} ]; then 
    if [ "args" = "" ]; then
        exec $editor -S ${vim_session_name}
    else
        exec $editor -S ${vim_session_name} "$args"
    fi
fi
